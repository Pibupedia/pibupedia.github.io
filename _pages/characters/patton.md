{% include quote.md quote="My friend, you are wrong there. All I do is honest work! My services can change your status around. Picked the wrong bonus during Ranking Up? I can fix that for you. For a price, of course. Hehehe..." speaker="Patton" %}**Paton** is a character in [*Bug Fables: The Everlasting Sapling*](/Bug_Fables:_The_Everlasting_Sapling). He can change your status in exchange of Berries.

## Appearance
Patton is an acorn weevil sporting a gray cloak and what looks like a gas mask. Patton has been exiled from the [Ant Kingdom](/Ant_Kingdom) due to his "blatant disregard for safety regulations".

## Personality
Patton lives just outside the Ant Kingdom's borders in a glass 'Beewell' medicine bottle in the Forsaken Lands.

Patton is very nosy but will volunteer his services for nothing more than having willing test subjects (and berries).

## Patton's Potion Respec

Patton is able to extract stat bonuses from level ups and upgrades such as Heart Berries, Bond Berries, Power Peppers and Iron Seeds (for 75 berries) once [Team Snakemouth](/Team_Snakemouth) reaches the Termite Capitol and Elizant II leaves the party.

The stat bonuses and upgrades you've applied are taken off Team Snakemouth and distilled into key-item potions that can be reapplied or converted to another kind (for 15 berries each).

Patton is unable to convert ATK, DEF and 1 HP/TP potions into other kinds of potions.
