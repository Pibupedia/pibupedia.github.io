The **Innkeeper** is an [ant](/ant) and the 7th owner of the [Ant Kingdom](/Ant_Kingdom) Inn, located in the main square of the [Ant Kingdom City](/Ant_Kingdom_City). She offers the quest [Inn Review Required](/Inn_Review_Required).

## Appearance
The Innkeeper is brown ant similar to other ants in the kingdom, with a dark brown body and abdomen while her head, arms, and legs are a more tan color. She has two black antennae which curl down behind her head most of the time. She has a white flower pattern on the top of her abdomen.

## Personality
She comes off as grumpy a majority of the time, almost sounding bored whenever she has to give a welcome to newcomers to her inn. However, she quickly perks up if someone actually expresses interest to stay at the inn or help her with a review. This suggests she really does want to see the inn succeed.
