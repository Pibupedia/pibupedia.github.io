**Tekci** is a former Explorer who has come to find more joy in traveling the world without any goal or reward in mind. This mindset forced her to reluctantly part ways with her former partner who instead found happiness in amassing wealth by completing as many quests as quickly as possible. Tekci is necessary to complete the quest [In Search of Something](/In_Search_of_Something), as hinted at by the phrase "Golden Paradise" that both she and [Elom](/Elom) use.

She is found at the peak of the [Golden Hills](/Golden_Hills), close to where [Venus](/Venus) is known to reside. If [Team Snakemouth](/Team_Snakemouth) speaks to her after taking Elom's quest, she will offer to try and lift his spirits.

Upon meeting Elom, the two mole crickets quickly form a bond, at which point the quest ends and the team is rewarded a [Lore Book](/Lore_Books).

<br />

## Personality
She is shown as very youthful and observant, and Elom considers her world view "refreshing".
