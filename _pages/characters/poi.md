**Poi** and [Cross](/Cross)** **are a pair of [termite](/termite) border guards the team first encounter on their way to [Termite Capitol](/Termite_Capitol) after beating the [Primal Weevil](/Primal_Weevil). They are later fought in the Termite Capitol's [Colosseum](/Colosseum) as part of the Termite Kingdom's test of strength. Poi mainly focuses on sword strikes and leaves the ranged combat for Cross, although he does have a few cannon attacks up his sleeve.

He can raise his or Cross' stats with [spicy](/Spicy_Berry) or [burly](/Burly_Berry) berries and heal himself with [Succulent Platters](/Succulent_Platter).

{% include spies.md Bestiary="Poi is a disciplined border guard who follows the law to the letter. He makes sure to keep his partner Cross on track. He uses a sword to complement his naturally long-range attacks." Kabbu="Our apologies, Poi. We know you're just doing your job. Everyone, watch out for his sword and cannon! We must fight with honor!" Vi="This guy's bonkers... He's got a cannon on his head! We just have to show them we're a much stronger team!" Leif="Tough luck, getting sent to fight us as part of the job. The head cannon and sword are a nasty combo... We can't let our guard down. Termites handle the cold well. Guess it's up to us if we want to gamble on it." %}

## Battle Information
TBD

## Trivia
* Succulent Platters used by Cross and Poi are weaker than the normal ones, as they can only target a single character.
    * Poi's Berries are also weaker than the normal versions, lasting only one turn.
