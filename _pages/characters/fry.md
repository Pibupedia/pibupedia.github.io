## Overworld Spy
**Vi:** "This is Fry, the fly! Most chefs live in the royal castle, but he chose to work here. Though I don't get it. He could make more profit at the castle."

**Kabbu:** "He probably just wants to see his fellow, common bug smile."

**Leif:** "There has to be more to it than that..."

**Vi:** "What matters is I'm really hungry. Let's get him to cook for us!

**Leif:** "We could go for a Mushroom Salad."

**Kabbu:** "Hmm, a Cooked Shroom would do me good."

**Vi:** " What's with you and shrooms? Aphid Omelette all the way!"

**Kabbu:** "Let's make sure we have the proper ingredients, first."

## Trivia
* Fry appears in the earliest demo of the game, and his quote in that version is already nearly the same as in the final version.
* He quit being the royal chef so that everybody in the [Ant Kingdom](/Ant_Kingdom) could taste his dishes.[<sup>[1]</sup>](#references)
