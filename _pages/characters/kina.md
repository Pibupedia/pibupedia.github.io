**Kina** is the overprotective sister of [Maki](/Maki), as well as one third of [Team Maki](/Team_Maki). She is always following her brother, unless he manages to sneak away from her.

## Appearance
Like most mantises, she is very tall and slender. Her body is primarily cherry pink with red legs and a pale red abdomen. Her eyes, too, are red and feature pupils, a trait common with mantises. Around her neck is a magenta scarf. Unique only to her, her antennae are curled into a heart shape.

## Personality
Kina is normally reserved, polite and caring, especially towards her brother. She shows concern whenever her brother goes missing. However, she is also known to harbor quite the short-fused temper, as seen when [Leif](/Leif) bluntly suggests Maki went missing to get some space from her; a sentiment she did not take with jest.

## Story
{% include collapsetable.md input="Read Story..." input1="### Chapter 1 After Maki hands out an explorer's permit to [Team Snakemouth](/Team_Snakemouth), Kina appears and urges Maki to go somewhere. Kina and Maki are not seen again for the remainder of the chapter.  ### Chapter 5 After the [Wasp King](/Wasp_King) attacks the [Ant Kingdom City](/Ant_Kingdom_City), Kina stays back at [Defiant Root](/Defiant_Root) with [Yin](/Yin).  ### Chapter 7 Kina supports the Team Maki with their travel in [Giant's Lair](/Giant's_Lair), but unlike Maki, she is purely an NPC here. She also takes care of Yin there, though she shows an anger towards Yin as well as an overprotectiveness of her brother.   ### Post Game Kina helps Team Snakemouth driving away the Leafbugs while Yin morphs into a moth. After that, she can be fought in front of [Anthill Palace](/Anthill_Palace)." %}
## Trivia
