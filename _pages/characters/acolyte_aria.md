She is also part of the quest [Team Snakemouth...](/Team_Snakemouth...) later on.

{% include spies.md Bestiary="One of Venus' acolytes, Aria spends her time in the Golden Settlement, preaching the words of Venus herself. She prays in order to summon vines, which she can use to attack or to propel herself for a nasty kick." Kabbu="Acolyte Aria...I cannot believe how much power her faith has bestowed upon her. Her vine platform is troublesome. I'll cut it down if I must!" Vi="What the heck? You're telling me prayer lets Aria summon huge vines!? Maybe I should start praying too... Meh. I'll just use my Beemerang to hit her while she's up in the air!" Leif="Impressive. We thought Aria was just an obsessed preacher but...To be able to fight this well is commendable. Still, we'll make sure to freeze the vines she summons!" %}

## Personality
Aria appears to live a secluded life style, spending all her time serving Venus. Although, it's revealed in her diary that she didn't believe in Venus for most of her life, even during her priestess training. However, just when she was about to leave Golden Settlement and find work elsewhere, she personally saw Venus at Golden Hills' summit, changing her view completely.

## Battle Information
In battle, Aria perches on a vine which must be damaged to knock her down to ground level. Only two members of Team Snakemouth may fight her, one of which must be Kabbu. During her battle, she can summon vines to attack the party, or increase her attack or defense stats. While on her vine perch, she can also jump off and deal a drop kick that deals large damage to a single party member.

After reaching a certain health threshold, she will summon a [Venus' Bud](/Venus'_Bud).

## Overworld Spy
**Leif:** "An acolyte, huh. It's so unusual to see someone so deep in their faith."

**Kabbu:** "Well, of all places, the Golden Settlement worships a very specific Goddess."

**Vi:** "And it's worked out pretty good for them!"

**Kabbu:** "Indeed. It's not too uncommon to see devout followers around."

**Leif:** "Every place has a different culture, huh."

## Trivia
* Aria is fought with a full team in her [B.O.S.S.](/B.O.S.S.) rematch. She also doesn't start the fight on a vine.
* The fact that she is a Mantis and a Worshipper may be play on words for "Praying Mantis".
* It is implied that she used to be the bar keep for the bar below the sunset inn before being replaced by [Tim](/Tim)[<sup>[1]</sup>](#references)
