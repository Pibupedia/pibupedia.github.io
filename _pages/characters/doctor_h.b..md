Hologram" %}**Doctor H.B.** (**Honeybee**)[<sup>[1]</sup>](#references), sometimes referred to as simply 'the doctor', or 'the Professor', is a [bee](/bee) scientist in the [Bee Kingdom Hive](/Bee_Kingdom_Hive). She is known for using [roach](/roach) technology and arguing a lot with the other bee scientist, [Professor Honeycomb](/Professor_Honeycomb).

## Appearance
H.B. is a thin, light-colored bee with bent antennae. She wears cracked glasses and a ragged grey lab coat. She is usually seen frowning and slouching with her hands in her pockets.

## Personality

Doctor H.B. makes sure that her assistant [Crow](/Crow) is constantly busy, and gets mad at her whenever the player challenges her to a spy cards match.

She shows great interest in Leif's 'fascinating' condition, which triggers his involuntary defense mechanism (the bubble shield) and causes the moth to dislike coming back to H.B.'s lab. Kabbu thinks she's nice for not forcing Leif to an examination, but Vi seems to think she's just creepy.

## History

### Chapter 3: Factory Inspection
She is primarily important in [Chapter 3: Factory Inspection](/Chapter_3:_Factory_Inspection), as she is the one who builds the replacement artifact. (Along with her assistant, [Crow](/Crow).)

At the beginning of Chapter 3, she offers to give [Leif](/Leif) an examination (by cutting him open) to see what it is inside of him that set off the scanners at the entrance to the Bee Hive.

After Chapter 3, she runs the Battery Operated Super Simulator (or [B.O.S.S.](/B.O.S.S.)) program, which allows players to re-face bosses and mini-bosses from previous chapters and win badges and berries as a reward.

She appears on the title screen along with Crow after completing Chapter 3.

## Trivia
* According to a bee guard in the hive, she and [Prof. Honeycomb](/Prof._Honeycomb) are the last bees left from the previous generation.
* Dr. H.B. and Professor Honeycomb used to be different designs for the same character, before becoming their own individual characters. [<sup>[2]</sup>](#references)
* Dr. H.B. and Professor Honeycomb are indirectly based off of a pair of scientists from one of Mar's old comics.[<sup>[3]</sup>](#references)
