**Aebees**[<sup>[1]</sup>](#references) is a [bee](/bee) that guards the entrance to the [Far Grasslands](/Far_Grasslands) from the [Lost Sands](/Lost_Sands).

## Personality
Aebees is very dedicated to her job, and loyal to [her queen](/Queen_Bianca). She will refuse passage through the border to Wasp territory to anyone who asks. However, she is traumatized and sent into hiding after the [Wasp King](/Wasp_King) and his forces break down the gate to start their invasion on the [Ant Kingdom City](/Ant_Kingdom_City). Scolding herself for her failure to protect the gate, she heads to Defiant Root where she drowns her sorrows with [Berry Juice](/Berry_Juice) at the bar. Eventually, she is reassigned to guard Queen Bianca in [Bee Kingdom Hive](/Bee_Kingdom_Hive)'s throne room. Despite acting meeker than usual, she still remains loyal to her duties and willing to do her job.

## Trivia
* In Bee Kingdom Hive, [Leif](/Leif) is shown to admire Aebees' continued work efforts.
* [Vi](/Vi) mentions having never seen her appear so "meek" in Bee Kingdom Hive, compared to her more intimidating behavior near the Far Grasslands gate.
