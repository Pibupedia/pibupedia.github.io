**Madeleine** is found in [Bugaria Outskirts](/Bugaria_Outskirts), near [Explorers' Association](/Explorers'_Association). She has a butler named [Seb](/Seb), and is the quest giver of [Butler Missing!](/Butler_Missing!) and [Butler Missing Again!](/Butler_Missing_Again!). 

During the latter quest, she accompanies the team in the battle, similarly to [Maki](/Maki), attacking after the party has made their moves. She attacks by striking the enemy twice with her umbrella, each hit dealing 2 damage.

Madeleine is also quite fond of [Seb](/Seb), requesting assistance from Team Snakemouth after he goes missing twice.

## Trivia
