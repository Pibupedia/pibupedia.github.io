**Leif** is one of the three protagonists in [*Bug Fables: The Everlasting Sapling*](/Bug_Fables:_The_Everlasting_Sapling). He is the third and final member required to join [Team Snakemouth](/Team_Snakemouth).

## Appearance
Unlike most moths, his head, torso, limbs and abdomen are coloured cyan blue. He has navy blue wings with gold highlights that he uses as a cloak of sorts over his body, as well as a fluffy gold collar around his neck. Like most bugs, he has a pair of black antennae atop his head.

| When Leif was alive, his head, torso, limbs, abdomen and wings were the same red instead of different shades of blue (Body is cyan, wings are navy blue) with the same gold highlights and collar, and his eyes were a light brown color, instead of white. He is shown wearing his wings like a cloak when he was alive.[<sup>[2]</sup>](#references)

## Personality
Leif presents himself as well-mannered and polite, speaking in a royal "We" instead of using "I". He is also known to be knowledgeable and intelligent, as he suggests several means of traversing [Snakemouth Den](/Snakemouth_Den). However, he is also quite blunt and often inconsiderate of the feelings of others, as exemplified in the demo when he suggests to [Kina](/Kina) the possibility that her brother, [Maki](/Maki), left her to get some space from her.

Despite this bluntness, he is shown to be loyal to those he trusts, namely [Team Snakemouth](/Team_Snakemouth). Despite his stoic facade, however, Leif is shown to have a weak spot towards domesticated bugs like Aphids or even towards smaller characters such as [Tanjerin](/Tanjerin), often calling them "cute".

## Abilities
Due to strange circumstances surrounding his time in the magic-drenched Snakemouth Den, Leif is able to utilize ice magic. He is also shown to have literacy in the Roaches' language. 

In the field, Leif can freeze water to form paths and platforms as well as freeze enemies to bounce around and use to solve puzzles. He can also create a shield that protects the party from hazards, and the shield can first strike an enemy in the overworld when they make contact, eventually he also learns to hover by carrying himself (and any other followers if present) on a block of ice, but he only does this to follow Vi when she flies as the party leader.

In battle, Leif acts as the party's mage. He is able to freeze enemies for a short period of time and deals 1 extra damage against plant-like enemies. Upon hitting a frozen enemy, it will deal extra damage. He is also able to increase the damage or defense to the party or decrease enemies' damage or defense. He owns the most move [medals](/medals) in the game.
