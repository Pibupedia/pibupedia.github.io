**Carmina** is a character first found in the [Underground Tavern](/Underground_Tavern). She specializes in [Spy Cards](/Spy_Cards), and introduces it to the Team when first talked to. She can later be found on [Metal Island](/Metal_Island), as an opponent in the tournament arena and as a secret mid-boss. She was designed by CasketCat.{% include spies.md Bestiary="A master of all games, Carmina loves playing for keeps, building wealth and outsmarting her opponents. Taunts and rule-sharking are all fair game, although she'd never cheat. On Metal Island, she had a hostile encounter with Team Snakemouth after they barged into her room uninvited."

## Appearance
Carmina is a red and black Velvet Ant. She has patterns on her body in the style of traditional card suits; red heart and diamond shapes on her front, and black spades on her abdomen. She also wears a magenta choker around her neck and consistently has playing cards readied in her hand like a fan.

## Personality
As a regular gambler, Carmina is often proud of her keen skills when playing against others, and loves nothing more than to win berries off of any overconfident or unprepared opponent. However, she takes her fair losses in stride.

## Battle Information
The team fights her when they run into her by digging through the crack in the tournament arena and reach her private room. In this battle, she has average stats comparing to other mini-bosses fought at the same time (assuming [Team Snakemouth](/Team_Snakemouth) is at the end of [Chapter 3: Factory Inspection](/Chapter_3:_Factory_Inspection), the earliest time for Team Snakemouth to be able to enter the tournament), but her attacks are random. 

She begins her turn by spinning a roulette. Depending on where it lands, it may heal or injure ally-or-enemy for 3, boost Carmina's stats, among other results. Her card toss attack inflicts a random [status effect](/Status_Effects) if not blocked, and her dice attack will deal a fixed amount of damage from 1 to 6 (regardless of Team Snakemouth's defense or game modes) depending on its result. 
## Strategies
Because of her random status attack, it can undermine Team Snakemouth's plans if using status-based strategies to defeat her.

The randomized and uncontrollable dice can be problematic if the team has bad luck when hit by it. 

As her randomness implies, Team Snakemouth can get very lucky or very unlucky while fighting Carmina. However, if Team Snakemouth is prepared well enough, she can be overcome.

## Trivia
[thumb](/File:Carmina_Smoking.png)
* Despite Carmina being called a 'Velvet ant', the family *Mutillidae* are actually a type of solitary wasp.
* Losing a battle against Carmina in Metal Island does not result in a Game Over. Instead, a cutscene is shown where Team Snakemouth gets kicked out of Carmina's room as she shuts the door behind them.
* Carmina can actually be first seen during the Golden Festival, dueling [Arie](/Arie). This gives foreshadowing to the latter's card master status, prior to the team learning about Spy Cards.
* Carmina was originally going to smoke (presumably from her appearance at the Underground Tavern), but was cut due to drug/tobacco-use potentially raising the game's age rating. She was given a fan of cards to hold in some of her sprites instead. [<sup>[1]</sup>](#references)
