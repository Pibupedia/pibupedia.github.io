For each new area in each chapter, the amount of berries you have to pay to open a mine increases.

She spends most her time sleeping, storing up energy for when she has to start mining. After waking up, though, she'll eat berries to get the rest of her energy up for even more strength. She is one of the few bugs who enjoys eating berries, notable for being hard and not pleasant tasting.

After every tunnel has been opened, she can be found in the back room of the Ant Mines eating berries and resting. If Team Snakemouth talks with her, she'll give them some berries based on the number of times you paid her to open tunnels early, up to 100 if you paid her every time, feeling bad for having asked for so many prior.
