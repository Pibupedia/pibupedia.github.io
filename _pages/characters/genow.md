{% include characters.md image1="Genow.png" species="[Bumblebee](/Bee)" found_at="[Defiant Root](/Defiant_Root)" %}{% include quote.md quote="It's going to look wonderful in my room. Can't wait to tell [my teammate](/Mar)!" speaker="Genow" %}**Genow** is a bumblebee found in [Defiant Root](/Defiant_Root)'s market. He is the persona of one of Bug Fables' developers, Jose Fernando Gracia.

He is involved in the long line of trades in [Vi's Request](/Vi's_Request), trading his [Root Cloth](/Root_Cloth) for the [Ant Doll](/Ant_Doll), obtained by trading with [Ann](/Ann). The Root Cloth can then be traded to a bee in the [Golden Settlement](/Golden_Settlement).

## Appearance
Like most bumblebees, he has a lot of fur, which can be unbearable in the heat of Defiant Root. However, he wears a blue scarf too, so it doesn't seem like he minds the heat very much.

## Personality
A notable trait is his affinity for souvenirs from other kingdoms, namely the [Ant Kingdom](/Ant_Kingdom). When he receives the Ant Doll from [Team Snakemouth](/Team_Snakemouth), he is excited to place it in his room and show it to his friend.[Category:Characters](/Category:Characters)
