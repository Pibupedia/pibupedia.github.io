And monsters can't see you if you can't see them, you know?" speaker="Cerise" %}**Cerise** is a character in [*Bug Fables: The Everlasting Sapling*](/Bug_Fables). She was created by Carson "LightningAcorns" (a.k.a. Pines) and Kassie "purupurple," along with [Tanjerin](/Tanjerin).

## Appearance
Cerise is a Cherry [Fruity Bug](/Fruity_Bug), a rotund species that has evolved to look like fruit. Cerise's species, the Fruity Bug, does not exist in real life. As of now, this is the only fictitious sentient species to appear in the game. However, she bears a resemblance to a common beetle with fruit-like elements. Cerise specifically appears as her namesake: a red cherry. Her head and back are a pinkish red color, and her belly is pastel with a pink cherry blossom petal pattern on it. She also has two leaves on her head which look like a bow.

## Personality
Cerise is shown to prefer sleeping underground, and seems to sleep a lot. She seems to be mostly unaware of her surroundings, as when first spoken to she claims to not know what a jail is. Similar to Tanjerin, she's also not very smart, but she's much sweeter in personality. Cerise is a bit childish, giving Kabbu an affectionate nickname: "Uncle Iron Seed". She fixates on Kabbu specifically because he resembles her own kind the most out of the members of Team Snakemouth, not recognizing the other two's species, having initially believed them to be monsters. She gives helpful advice about digging, having learned to do so to avoid danger. She has attempted to eat a [Crystal Berry](/Crystal_Berries), stating that it does not taste good.

She cares a great deal for her boyfriend [Tanjerin](/Tanjerin), expressing great joy when reunited with him after traveling all the way to Bugaria to bring him back home after being gone for too long. Both of them are horrible with directions, but somehow managed to find their way to the Golden Settlement regardless of the perils of travel.

## History
Cerise fell out of the tree where all the others live when she was pupating, so she has a problem with heights and lives with her adoptive papa at the base. [Tanjerin](/Tanjerin) went down there to train (break things) and met her and became friends. Ever since then, their love grew, and now they're boyfriend and girlfriend.

Sometime during the events of *Bug Fables: The Everlasting Sapling*, she was instructed to bring Tanjerin back to their homeland, as his abroad training had come to a close. She tunnels her way into the [Bandit Hideout](/Bandit_Hideout)'s prison to take a nap underground, unaware of what a prison is. After speaking with Team Snakemouth and handing them a Crystal Berry, she returns to her search for Tanjerin and reunites with him in the post-game.

## Trivia
* Cerise was initially not canon, but as a thank-you gift to LightningAcorns for helping with the game, she was added as a favor, specifically to be a birthday gift for purupurple.
* According to to LightningAcorns, Cerise is about 20 years old.[<sup>[1]</sup>](#references)
* Cerise's "Okie-love-you-bye-bye" to Team Snakemouth is a reference to Mindy from *Animaniacs (1993)*, who similarly says, "Okay I love you bye-bye!"
