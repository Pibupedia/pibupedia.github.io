**Mun** lives in [Ant City](/Ant_Kingdom_City)'s residential district with [Eophi](/Eophi). He is part of the quest [Help me Get it Back!](/Help_me_Get_it_Back!), made available by witnessing him being antagonized by desert bandits in the East Outskirts. During this quest, he will accompany you into battle much like [Maki](/Maki) during Chapter 5, attacking after the party has made their moves. Sadly, he only deals 1 damage, causing his kick to fail against any enemies with any Defense such as [Bandits](/Bandit) and [Burglars](/Burglar).

## Trivia
* Mun is an Orchid Mantis nymph, which is also referred as "Kung Fu mantis".
