**Jayde** is a character in *[Bug Fables: The Everlasting Sapling](/Bug_Fables:_The_Everlasting_Sapling)*. She is a janitor living in the [Wasp Kingdom Hive](/Wasp_Kingdom_Hive). When Team Snakemouth first meets Jayde, she is residing in her workplace behind the prison block. She expresses boredom and annoyance towards the group until she mistakes them for the Bug Rangers. As a huge fan, she immediately starts being more friendly to the point of worshipping [Team Snakemouth](/Team_Snakemouth). After this meeting, she sets up a shop which will offer a variety of goods, including an exclusive item called [Jayde's Stew](/Jayde's_Stew).

After the defeat of [General Ultimax](/General_Ultimax) and the Wasp soldiers in the Hive, Jayde is able to escape and find refuge at the [Golden Settlement](/Golden_Settlement). Upon speaking with Team Snakemouth once more, she informs them that she will be opening up a shop in the village and selling her famous stew.

## Trivia
* The reason why Jayde was not affected by the Wasp King's mind control is due to a pendant [Queen Vanessa II](/Queen_Vanessa_II) gave her. [<sup>[1]</sup>](#references)
* Jayde was based on a character from an early Moonsprout project. This version of Jayde was a humanoid bee who betrayed the rest of her kind and join the party if they would've answered some questions correctly.[<sup>[2]</sup>](#references)
