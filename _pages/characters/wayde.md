Team Snakemouth can also ask Wayde is he okay when talking to him. The first time, he'll reply that he's alright and coming to terms with things that happened to him. When asked again after the party rested in his inn has, he explains that he used to have a [Termite partner](/Tynn) who returned to [Termite Capitol](/Termite_Capitol) after termites were called back by [the king](/King_Hector_IV) once they isolated themselves due to [Queen Elizant II](/Queen_Elizant_II)'s actions.

The room above the inn is unlocked as well, allowing the party to collect the [Lore Book](/Lore_Books) located inside.

## Personality
Ever since his partner left, Wayde has entered the state of depression. Despite his sadness, he's still willing to keep the inn running and tries not to let his feelings interfere with his work or when dealing with customers. After telling the team his story with Tynn, he says that he contemplates removing Tynn's half of sign out of belief that she'll never come back, though he never goes through the deed.

Wayde's spirits are lifted when he and Tynn reunite, and he gets eager to run the inn with his partner once more, happily welcoming customers with her.
