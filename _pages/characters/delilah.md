{% include spies.md Bestiary="Team Slacker's wit. She's turned selling information into a profitable venture. She's gathered many poisons while exploring, which she can use to incapacitate more powerful enemies. Her favorite drink is Doppel's Berry Juice." Kabbu="Miss Delilah is suddenly so menacing...! And that's without her impressive weapon. It can seal away our items! Those bombs carry most cumbersome effects. We must make sure to stay healthy!" Vi="A bazooka!? Did you get that from Shades!? It's full of bombs! Woah, that's a sticky bomb! We can't use items if that hits, they cost a fortune!" Leif="Items, bombs and speed... Delilah is more resourceful than we anticipated. Losing access to our items would be awful. We should probably incapacitate her first." %}
