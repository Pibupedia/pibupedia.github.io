**Chompy** is a baby [Chomper](/Chomper) born from the [Chomper Seed](/Chomper_Seed) obtained after defeating [Mother Chomper](/Mother_Chomper) in [Chomper Cave](/Chomper_Cave). After finding the [Tardigrade Shield](/Tardigrade_Shield) medal and the [Heaven Key](/Heaven_Key), the seed can be given to [Professor Honeycomb](/Professor_Honeycomb) to sprout it. Chompy serves as an optional supportive party member to [Team Snakemouth](/Team_Snakemouth). 

## Appearance
Chompy has a pink bud, with light orange petals attached to its back, as well as a pale yellow stem. She seems to have a smile on her face rather than an angry frown, due to her harmless nature from being brought up in Professor Honeycomb's lab. When a Ribbon is given to her, the ribbon is equipped near her petals.

[Team Snakemouth](/Team_Snakemouth) can change Chompy's name when she is first born and later by talking to [Hawk](/Hawk) in the lab.

## History
Midway into their adventure (sometime after the events of [Chapter 3](/Chapter_3:_Factory_Inspection)), after Leif learns the Bubble Shield skill, they explore a cavern known as [Chomper Cave](/Chomper_Cave), located along the [Golden Path](/Golden_Path). Within it, they defeat the optional mini-boss [Mother Chomper](/Mother_Chomper). 

After obtaining a [Chomper Seed](/Chomper_Seed) from defeating Mother Chomper, the party takes it to [Defiant Root](/Defiant_Root)'s [Bee Kingdom Hive](/Bee_Kingdom_Hive), delivering it to [Professor Honeycomb](/Professor_Honeycomb). After [Hawk](/Hawk) returns from investigating the desert after Team Snakemouth acquires the [Tardigrade Shield](/Tardigrade_Shield), Professor Honeycomb allows the seed to incubate and eventually grow into the team's fourth member, a baby [Chomper](/Chomper) whose name defaults to **Chompy**, but can be changed to anything Team Snakemouth desires.

## Battle Stats
Chompy has three moves: Attack, Do Nothing, and Change Ribbon. The attack is a bite with a base damage of 2, and it will automatically target the nearest ground enemy. To perform the action command, press the button shown when the icon turns green. If the action command fails or if there are no available targets, Chompy will trip over and no damage is dealt. She can gain access to higher stats or more attack with Ribbons.

In [HARDEST](/Menu_Codes) mode, Chompy's attack power is 1 higher.

Chompy always stands behind all team members and cannot act until all main party members have acted. If you have a helper on your team, they'll act after Chompy. She also doesn't have HP and thus is never targeted by enemies.

## Ribbons
Ribbons can enhance Chompy's stats or attacks, depending on its type. To equip a Ribbon, leave Chompy at the lab or at her bed in the team's house and give her the ribbon you want her to equip, or you can change it during the battle.
