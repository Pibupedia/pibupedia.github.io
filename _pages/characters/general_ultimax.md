**Fuff**, who goes by the name **General Ultimax** while under the **[Wasp King](/Wasp_King)**<nowiki/>'s brainwashing, is a Wasp who is the military leader of the [Wasp Kingdom](/Wasp_Kingdom), and is the secondary antagonist of *Bug Fables: The Everlasting Sapling*.

The [team](/Team_Snakemouth) fights him twice - first in the Wasp Kingdom, where he stalls them so that they won't realize that the Wasp King has tricked them too soon, second in the [Rubber Prison](/Rubber_Prison), this time driving his [ULTIMAX Tank](/ULTIMAX_Tank). After the battle, he still tries to stop the explorers from progressing due to the Wasp King's mind control. [Leif](/Leif) harmlessly freezes him before moving on.

He is later seem reformed after the game is completed, no longer under mind control.{% include spies.md Bestiary="A master of machinations and delegation, he is responsible for leading the Wasp King's missions. While physically inept and a coward, he still commands the respect of his troops. Most likely due to fear of the Wasp King. Also, his actual name is Fuff." Kabbu="So you're the one who led the charge on the Ant Kingdom... I cannot forgive you! He seems to rely heavily on his troops. Let's clear them out first and deliver justice!" Vi="Grr! We don't have time for this! We've gotta get to the Wasp King! For a general, this guy's really weak... I'll beat up everyone else first!" Leif="Don't think you'll get away with bringing harm to those in our city. Big mistake. We'll beat you up nice and slow, after we deal with your pathetic lackeys." %}

## Appearance

Most of Ultimax's body is covered by his red and black military uniform. His head and limbs are colored brown, as opposed to most wasps' yellow.

## Personality
Ultimax is very arrogant, boastful and loud, although he's implied to be smarter than he lets on. His personality is likely influenced by the Wasp King's brainwashing, as he meekly apologizes to the party during the epilogue ceremony and is on friendly terms with them afterwards.

## Battle Information
General Ultimax himself is very weak, being only able to deal a small amount of damage on his own, choosing instead to support his minions or using battle vehicles. On the first battle against him he starts with a [Wasp Driller](/Wasp_Driller) and a [Wasp Bomber](/Wasp_Bomber), assisting them by raising their stats and healing them (although he has a high chance to waste his turn laughing); in the 2nd fight, he starts inside his [ULTIMAX Tank](/ULTIMAX_Tank) instead. In both fights he is rather easy to take out on his own. Having said that, his damage is increased by [Hard Hits](/Hard_Hits), [Ex Boss Rushes](/B.O.S.S.), and [HARDEST Mode](/Menu_Codes), being able to easily KO a weak character. 
## Strategies
In the first fight, the team should focus fire on the other wasps first, then take out Ultimax, making sure to use defense piercing attacks. While [Icefall](/Skills#Leif's_Skills) hits all enemies with a chance to Freeze, it won't deal much damage without several damage increases on Leif. [Frost Bowling](/Skills#Team_Skills) is very useful here, if the team has it. On Hard Mode, it can take out the Wasp Bomber in 2 uses with a single damage increase, or 1 use with 3, while dealing a lot of damage to the Wasp Driller with a chance to Freeze him. 

Alternatively, giving [Kabbu](/Kabbu) a damage increase, and with him in the front line, and use [Under Strike](/Skills#Kabbu's_Skills) on the two front Wasps twice in one turn for 12 damage to both of them.
