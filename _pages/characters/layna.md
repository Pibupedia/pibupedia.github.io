**Layna** is a minor recurring character in [*Bug Fables: The Everlasting Sapling*](/Bug_Fables:_The_Everlasting_Sapling). She is a firefly, who journeys around the land with her pet [Nero](/Nero). The first time she and Nero can be encountered is in [Chapter 2: Sacred Golden Hills](/Chapter_2:_Sacred_Golden_Hills) during the [Golden Festival](/Golden_Festival) in the [Golden Settlement](/Golden_Settlement).

Following this, she will be encountered again in [Termite Capitol](/Termite_Capitol). Here, she is by herself, and will look rather distraught. Talking to her will make [Best Friend In The Fog!](/Best_Friend_In_The_Fog!) available on the quest board.
