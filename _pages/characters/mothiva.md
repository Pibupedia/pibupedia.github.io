**Mothiva** is one of the most popular stars in [Bugaria](/Bugaria). [Zasp](/Zasp), the wasp warrior, helps her a lot in her career. Together they form [Team Mothiva](/Team_Mothiva).

## Appearance
Mothiva appears as most moths. Her entire body is cream-coloured with patches of white fluff around her chest, waist, hips and legs. Her wings are also quite fluffy, being primarily used as a cape or robe. Around her antenna is a cherry red decoration that appears similar to a flower.

## Personality
While in public, Mothiva presents herself as kind and loving towards all of her fans. This is all a facade. In truth she is snide, disrespectful towards peers and incredibly vain. She wishes for nothing more than for others to see her as the shining star she believes she is. This is made more apparent during her demo quest when she constantly, yet secretly, berates [Team Snakemouth](/Team_Snakemouth) for ruining her show, yet assures herself that the audience enjoyed her presence nonetheless.

## Trivia
* In the demo, Mothiva gives the [Theater Help Wanted!](/Theater_Help_Wanted!) quest instead of [M.M.](/M.M.)
* Her name is a portmanteau of the words "moth", her species, and "diva", a word for a famous female pop singer or a self important person who is difficult to please.
* The [creator](/Futes) of Mothiva and Zasp, alongside the [writer](/Genow) of [*Bug Fables: The Everlasting Sapling*](/Bug_Fables:_The_Everlasting_Sapling) confirmed that Mothiva and Zasp are [romantically involved with each other.](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/418583669717073950/726511358664900669/xczczvxcvx.png?width=576&height=633)
* In the text file of H.B.'s lab, there is an unused [B.O.S.S.](/B.O.S.S.) option for the third fight with Zasp and Mothiva. This implies that Zasp and Mothiva were supposed to have three fights over the course of the game instead of two.
* According to Mar, the musical notes that appear when Mothiva attacks are visualizations and not meant to imply she has magic.[<sup>[1]</sup>](#references)
