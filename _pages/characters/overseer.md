The** Overseer**, or **Beena**[<sup>[1]</sup>](#references), is a [bee](/bee), and more notably, the highest-ranking employee of the [Honey Factory](/Honey_Factory). She manages the operations involved in honey production and storage. She is also the only one with the authority to open the way to the core and to override Code 32.  

## Appearance
She is a bright yellow bee, with a clipboard in one hand and a wooden wrench in the other. Her cap is a light orange color, and has a little red flower accessory attached to it.

## Personality
Her position likely means she takes care of many responsibilities at the Honey Factory, and is a hard worker. She has knowledge of technologies even [Team Snakemouth](/Team_Snakemouth) can't comprehend, like the machine in her office.

During the Code 32 lockdown, she's trapped in storage, hiding at the top of a pile of crates in order to avoid the swarms of [Abomihoneys](/Abomihoney) below. Team Snakemouth rescues her, and for that she is very grateful. She changes her mind about [Vi](/Vi), and respects Vi's choice to become an explorer.
