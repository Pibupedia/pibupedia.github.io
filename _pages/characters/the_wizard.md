He spends his time in brewing magical ingredients, and does not like being disturbed. He also has a collection of books, which he does not want anyone to take out (except for a [Bad Book](/Bad_Book)). 

## Overview
The Wizard was one of the less than 10 known sorcerers, studying the [Ancient Crystals](/Ancient_Crystal). However, unknown events led to him moving to a tower in the Far Grasslands and isolating himself. 

## Chapter 5: The Far Wildlands
After [Team Snakemouth](/Team_Snakemouth) enters his tower, he gives the quest '[Find the Ingredients!](/Find_the_Ingredients!)'. The items needed for this quest are an [Aphid Dew](/Aphid_Dew), a [Magic Ice](/Magic_Ice) and a [Squash](/Squash). Once all items have been collected, the Wizard grants [Leif](/Leif) the [Frost Relay](/Skills#Leif) Skill.

## Appearance
The Wizard is a brown tarantula with yellow eyes and a typical wizard suit that covers his entire body. As an evolved bug, he walks with four legs.

## Personality
The Wizard seems to be very annoyed when in the presence of others, placing various signs in front of his tower that warn others to stay away and getting angry at [Team Snakemouth](/Team_Snakemouth) when they enter his home.

## Trivia
* Unlike other spiders, the Wizard uses purely 2D sprites instead of having his legs folded in 3D. The only spiders who share this trait with him are the [Mimic Spider](/Mimic_Spider)s.
* Various Tarantula wizard enemies appear in [Mite Knight](/Termacade).
