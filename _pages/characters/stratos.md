{% include spies.md Bestiary="Team Slacker's brawn. His giant stature betrays his kind disposition. His weapon isn't actually special - his proficiency with the blade makes the wood cut like steel. His favorite food is Plumpling Pie." Kabbu="Do not be fooled by his calm disposition, my friends. I can sense in Stratos the heart of a warrior! If we can't decipher his swordplay soon, we won't be able to block effectively!" Vi="Heheh. Leave it to me, guys! I'll buzz around hi-WOAH! H-He's so fast, what the heck!? That's not fair when he's so bulky!" Leif="...We underestimated them. What a shame that they didn't use this power to help us stop the Wasp King. Stratos can fire shockwaves from sheer strength...it's not even magic. What a guy." %}
