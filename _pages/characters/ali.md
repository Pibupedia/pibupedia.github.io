{% include characters.md image1="ali.png" species="Cicada[<sup>[1]</sup>](#references)" found_at="[Ant Kingdom City](/Ant_Kingdom_City)" title1="" caption1="" %}{% include quote.md quote="Oh, and, deliver it to [Libren](/Libren), ok? [Brooke](/Brooke)'s scary enough without turning in late..." speaker="Ali" %}**Ali** is a cicada who lives in the [Ant City Residential Area](/Ant_Kingdom_City). His house is a teacup, and is filled with books. The team can read one of a book in his home to learn about status effects.

In the quest [Book Return!](/Book_Return!), he asks the team to return his overdue book to the library.

## Appearance
Ali appears to be a purple cicada with green wings. He wears round glasses. He has a slightly slouching posture.

## Personality
He is well-read, as he probably reads the many books stored in his home, and also enlists [Gen and Eri](/Gen_and_Eri)'s help to receive books from the palace library due to him not being an [Ant](/Ant). One of the books, describing status effects, suggests that he may have an interest in studying status effects. He gets very absorbed into his reading, and is so busy with reading, he doesn't have the time to deliver his overdue book to the palace library himself. 

He prefers that the team deliver his overdue book to [Libren](/Libren) rather than [Brooke](/Brooke), because Brooke is less understanding. This turns out to be true, as Libren easily forgives the overdue book when the team delivers it, believing that they were too busy exploring.
