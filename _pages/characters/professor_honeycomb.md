**Professor Honeycomb **is a bee scientist in [Bee Kingdom Hive](/Bee_Kingdom_Hive). She is the inventor of Beemerang, and she also does other researches as well. Her assistant is [Hawk](/Hawk).

## Appearance
Professor Honeycomb is a pale yellow bee with light brown fur, as well as a pair of odd glasses whose lens differs in sizes to each other. One of her antennae is longer and curly.

## Personality
She often appears to be rude and forces the team to help her in her researches, but is actually helpful towards the team as well, and offers many help to them. When she found that [Vi](/Vi) owns one of her Beemerangs during the festival in [Golden Settlement](/Golden_Settlement), she is annoyed, and also ignores [Kabbu](/Kabbu)'s explanations, but she eventually agrees to let Vi keep the Beemerang, in exchange for assist in researches. Later when the team brings a Chomper Seed to her, she helps the team breeding it into [Chompy](/Chompy), but once again asks them to take care of her so that her experiment can continue.

She shows dislike towards [Doctor H.B.](/Doctor_H.B.), saying that most of her inventions are just stolen Roach technology.

## History
Professor Honeycomb is first encountered during the festival at the Golden Settlement, alongside [Hawk](/Hawk). During the festival, She makes Hawk upgrade Vi's [Beemerang](/Beemerang). 

Professor Honeycomb is later encountered in her lab in the [Bee Kingdom Hive](/Bee_Kingdom_Hive). 

After Chapter 4, the party can acquire the [A.D.B.P. Enhancer](/A.D.B.P._Enhancer) after [Hawk](/Hawk) has returned. To make Hawk return to the lab, the [Tardigrade Shield](/Tardigrade_Shield) medal and [Heaven Key](/Heaven_Key) must already have been found. In addition, after Hawk has returned, if Team Snakemouth acquires a [Chomper Seed](/Chomper_Seed), the party can deliver it to Professor Honeycomb. Professor Honeycomb allows the seed to incubate and eventually grow into the team's fourth member, a baby [Chomper](/Chomper) whose name defaults to [Chompy](/Chompy), but can be changed to anything Team Snakemouth desires. The team can also leave Chompy with Professor Honeycomb and Hawk if they do not want Chompy to follow them.
