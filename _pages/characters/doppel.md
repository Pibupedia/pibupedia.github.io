**Doppel** is a ladybug in the [Underground Tavern](/Underground_Tavern). He masquerades as a Beetle (complete with "horn") as a result of the [the queen's](/Queen_Elizant_II) ban on Ladybug residents. He gives [Team Snakemouth](/Team_Snakemouth) rewards for completing various [bounties](/Quests) if they bring the [Crystals](/Items) they leave behind to him as proof. Kabbu doesn't see through Doppel's disguise (or, pretends to for legality's sake), whereas Leif quickly recognizes Doppel as a ladybug, much to Doppel's immediate shock. 

## Trivia

* Doppel's name is a pun on the word doppelganger, referring to his disguise.
