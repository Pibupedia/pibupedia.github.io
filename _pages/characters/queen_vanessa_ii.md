**Queen Vanessa II** is the Queen of [Wasp Kingdom](/Wasp_Kingdom). She is one of the protagonists in the game. She rules the Kingdom before and after the game's event, where the [Wasp King](/Wasp_King) takes control of her kingdom instead. She owns a [Flame Brooch](/Flame_Brooch), which can grant the owner resistance to fire attacks that is normally fatal to bugs, and gives it to [Team Snakemouth](/Team_Snakemouth) after [Chapter 6](/Chapter_6:_Assault_on_Rubber_Prison).

## Appearance
Queen Vanessa II is an yellow orange wasp with grey and yellow wings. She has a pair of black eyes, and red crystals on her furs and legs.

## Personality
In spite of the Wasp Kingdom's aggressive nature, Queen Vanessa II is a kind wasp who wants all the wasps to get along well with citizens in Bugaria, and this causes her to become a controversial Queen. She also states she is not much of a fighter.

Her efforts were further pushed back when [Elizant II](/Queen_Elizant_II)'s inexperience ruined the relationship between ants and wasps. Despite this, she continued to keep working towards her goal of peace. This is all changed after Wasp King usurps her and takes control of the Wasp Kingdom. 

He then imprisons her in her room and tortures her, but the Flame Brooch protects her from his flames. She is eventually rescued by the Team Snakemouth in Chapter 5. She then offers to help Ant Kingdom on their quest in stopping the Wasp King. After the events of Chapter 6, she gives the team the brooch, which turns out to be a key factor to their eventual victory.

She can be seen at the [Wasp Kingdom Hive](/Wasp_Kingdom_Hive) again after beating the game, now on her rightful throne. She will award the team with 150 Berries when first talked to, and decides to let the team keep the Flame Brooch so that they can complete their adventure in Bugaria.

## Trivia
