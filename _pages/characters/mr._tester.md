**Mr. Tester** is a character that appears in [the game](/Bug_Fables:_The_Everlasting_Sapling)'s Test Room. As the name implies, he is used to test the combat system and mechanics. 

Due to the glitchy effect in his dialogue that's normally used in the dialogue boxes of other machines, it can be assumed he is a robot.
