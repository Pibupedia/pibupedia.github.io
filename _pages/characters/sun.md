**Sun**[<sup>[1]</sup>](#references) is a berry salesman who offers various stat increasing berries to [Team Snakemouth](/Team_Snakemouth) at his shop in [Defiant Root](/Defiant_Root).

## Appearance
He is a green beetle, bearing a great resemblance to [Kabbu](/Kabbu) in many aspects. [Vi](/Vi) even asks Kabbu if the Berry Salesman is his dad, but Kabbu says he is not, and that their colors are totally different hues. Apart from that, he carries a large bag behind him, presumably filled with rare berries.

## Personality
From his stall in the town marketplace, Sun implores Team Snakemouth to buy his stat-boosting berries, warning that they may spoil, but this could just be a marketing tactic.

The berries he sells are quite rare, as there are very few found elsewhere in the game, so he may have unique knowledge of ways to obtain these berries.
