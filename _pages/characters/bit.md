**Bit** is a character mentioned by [Kabbu](/Kabbu) during [Chapter 5](/Chapter_5:_The_Far_Wildlands). Bit, Kabbu, and [their master](/List_of_implied_characters#Kabbu's_master) traveled through the [Wild Swamplands](/Wild_Swamplands) to reach Bugaria, but both Kabbu's companions were eaten and killed by [the Beast](/the_Beast) that roams the area. The two sacrificed themselves to allow for Kabbu's survival. Bit was more skilled than Kabbu, leaving the latter as the rookie of the group.
