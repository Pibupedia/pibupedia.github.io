Malbee is a bee who works at the [Honey Factory](/Honey_Factory) where she tends to and fixes the [Menders](/Mender).  

## Appearance
Malbee is a dullish yellow Honey [Bee](/Bee). She wears an orange hard hat, green goggles, as well having an orange fluff around her neck and shoulders. Due to her goggles and frown, she appears to be in an angry or frustrated state of emotion. 
## Personality
Although intially Malbee shows a distain for [Vi](/Vi) and her being an explorer, after being saved from some [Abomihoneys](/Abomihoney) she changes her stance and accepts Vi's choice. 

After this however, her personality remains gruff and straight to the point. During the quest [Helpers Needed at Once!](/Helpers_Needed_at_Once!), the team ask how to fix the broken Menders, to which Malbee responds to shut whack them into their fixed. 
## Trivia

* After being saved, Malbee suggest Vi could come back to working in the factory. Although Vi rejects this proposition, this confirms the fact that her job prior to exploring was being a worker in the Honey Factory.
