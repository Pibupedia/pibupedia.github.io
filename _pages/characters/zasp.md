**Zasp** is a [Wasp](/Wasp) in the [Ant Kingdom](/Ant_Kingdom). He is one of the few Wasps to be accepted into the Ant Kingdom as an [explorer](/Exploration_Team). He's unaligned with the [Wasp Kingdom](/Wasp_Kingdom), instead loyal to [Mothiva](/Mothiva), forming [Team Mothiva](/Team_Mothiva) with her.

## Appearance
He is a tall and slender with crooked antennae. He has a crimson red head, chest and abdomen, and a brown torso and under abdomen, unlike most wasp, who have yellow and brown coloring. His upper legs are also red and on his back are brown wings. His arms, feet, mouth and stinger are all tan. Over his eye is a scar he attained from unknown means.

## Personality
Zasp starts off rude, often insulting Team Snakemouth during their encounters with him. However, after being rescued from the Ahoneynation in the Honey Factory, he lightens up, often helping the team out when Mothiva isn't nearby.

Zasp is obsessed with Mothiva, following her everywhere and doing everything she tells him to.

## Trivia
[thumb](/File:Zasp_0.1.mp4)
* Zasp is the only wasp to appear in the demo. He also appears in the v0.1 demo as one of the few characters there, as a secret boss.
* Zasp was the third fight in the theater side quest in the demo instead of the burglar. He also was fought alone, while in the full game he fights along side [Mothiva](/Mothiva) in both of their boss fights.
* Zasp is the quest giver of the "Lost Item" quest, although he covers himself with a cloak to prevent [Team Snakemouth](/Team_Snakemouth) from recognizing him.
* It has been confirmed by [Mothiva](/Mothiva) and Zasp's designer that they are in a relationship.[<sup>[1]</sup>](#references)
* In the demo V0.4 version, Leif's spy on Zasp was "We don't really know who you are, Zasp. Unlike Vi and Kabbu, we don't really care for you at all. That's why we will freeze you without hesitation!"
* In the text file of H.B.'s lab, there is an unused [B.O.S.S.](/B.O.S.S.) option for the third fight with Zasp and Mothiva. This implies that Zasp and Mothiva were supposed to have three fights over the course of the game instead of two.
* Zasp was originally going to have lightning powers and was supposed to hide them.[<sup>[2]</sup>](#references)
    * This is why Zasp's needles cause numb in the 0.1 demo. [<sup>[3]</sup>](#references)
    * Zasp's name originates from Zasp's scrapped lightning magic, being a portmanteau of "zap" and "wasp." [<sup>[4]</sup>](#references)
