**{% include pagename.md %}** is the owner of the Golden Emporium in the [Golden Settlement](/Golden_Settlement). He sells variety of [items](/items), but if the party would attempt to sell him items, he'll get irritated and decline their offer, explaining that he would go broke should he start buying from them, an act which earned him the ire of [Vi](/Vi), as shown in the Spy dialogue on him.

## Overworld Spy
**Vi:** "Ugh. This guy."

**Leif:** "What's wrong with him?"

**Vi:** "He won't buy our stuff! It's beyond rude!"

**Kabbu:** "Vi, you DO know the shopkeepers have no obligation to buy our items, right? This is a plentiful area, they are probably overstocked more than anything else..."

**Vi:** "Whatever. I'll go sell to the caravan. They know a good deal when they see it!"

**Leif:** "(Poor caravan...)"
