**Queen** **Elizant I** is a minor character in [*Bug Fables: The Everlasting Sapling*.](/Bug_Fables:_The_Everlasting_Sapling) Despite only ever appearing in the intro, her actions play a vital part in the story. 

## History

### Background
Before the event of the game, Queen Elizant I was sealed by the power of the Ancient Crystal, and she told her [daughter](/Queen_Elizant_II) of her wish of keeping [Ant Kingdom](/Ant_Kingdom) the same way as it was when she was still in charge of it before being put to the eternal sleep by the crystal. 

## Appearance
Queen Elizant I has a white suit and mask, and she usually doesn't take off the mask because she doesn't want to reveal her face to others. This is kept as a tradition, as her daughter also wears a mask and usually doesn't pull it off. 

## Personality
Queen Elizant I, although not directly appearing in the game, has been mentioned many times. According to [her daughter](/Queen_Elizant_II), Queen Elizant I was a very excellent and ambitious queen, that she ended wars with no combat, and also managed to keep a stable relationship with [Termite Kingdom](/Termite_Kingdom) and [Wasp Kingdom](/Wasp_Kingdom), allowing many species of bugs rather than just ants to reside in [Ant Kingdom](/Ant_Kingdom). [Leif](/Leif) was one of the bugs she and her minions trusted at that time, although he was captured by the [Spider](/Spuder) and did not return until being rescued by [Kabbu](/Kabbu) and [Vi](/Vi), by when Queen Elizant II took her place instead.
