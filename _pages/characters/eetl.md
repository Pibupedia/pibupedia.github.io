**Eetl** is a minor character that appears in [*Bug Fables: The Everlasting Sapling*](/Bug_Fables:_The_Everlasting_Sapling). He works in the [Explorers' Association](/Explorers'_Association), granting permits to up-and-coming [explorers](/Exploration_Team). He's in charge of the paperwork for the quest board, and in [RUIGEE](/Menu_Codes), he says he can rank up the team by doing some paperwork.

## History
Prior to the events of the game, Eetl was on a team that used to go exploring with [Div](/Div). However, he began to enjoy the administrative side more and the two chose different paths.

#### Chapter 1: A Dysfunctional Trio
Eetl refuses to grant [Vi](/Vi) an Explorer Permit, because he thinks she is still a child, and cannot handle exploring. Although, he isn’t saying this because he’s prejudice, since she is a bee and there has never been a bee explorer before. Instead, he simply cares about every bugs’ safety and doesn't want her to go alone. Still, even after [Maki's](/Maki) test he is hesitant to give [Kabbu](/Kabbu) and [Vi](/Vi) their Explorer Permit.

When the team comes back, he, [Gen, and Eri](/Gen_and_Eri) can be seen outside the [Association](/Explorers'_Association). Eetl is crying, afraid that [Team Snakemouth](/Team_Snakemouth) will never come back. When they do, he doesn't believe them when they say they got the [artifact](/Ancient_Artifacts), or even got into [Snakemouth Den](/Snakemouth_Den). After the team introduces [Leif](/Leif) and shows Eetl the mask, he is surprised they pulled it off. To show appreciation for their efforts, he christens Vi, Kabbu, and Leif "Team Snakemouth", and grants the team the privilege of having three members.

### Chapter 5: The Far Wildlands
Eetl is seen in shock at the [Association](/Explorers'_Association), where all the bugs evacuated from the Wasp Attack.

### Chapter 7: The Everlasting Sapling
After completing every [quest](/Quests), Eetl will congratulate the team and christen them as the explorer team of the month, as well as tell them the RUIGEE [Menu Code](/Menu_Codes).

## Overworld Spy
**Kabbu:** "Eetl watches over the quest board and helps teams with their tasks, correct?"

**Leif:** "So it seems. We can't imagine him questing, though."

**Vi:** "He's gotta relax more, too!"

**Kabbu:** "Vi, please don't cause him any trouble."

**Vi:** "I won't! ...As long as he doesn't cause ME trouble."

## Trivia
