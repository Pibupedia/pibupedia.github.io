## Personality
Riz is a green damsel fly who can craft various inventions. He seems to be very defensive towards everyone, even to those who he thinks good. On the other hand, he cares about his sister and is a responsible brother.

## Battle Information
For a side-boss, Riz can be a surprisingly formidable opponent. He has high HP, takes two actions per turn, and deals high damage, with his basic attack inflicting Ink status effect, sealing off a party member's skills. His Dive Bombs deal a lot of damage, and some of them inflict status effects, but can be easily countered by [Leif](/Leif)'s [Bubble Shield Lite](/Skills).

## Trivia
* Both Riz and Rizza are called 'dragonfly' in the file and in his old bestiary log, despite this Riz and his family are actually Damsel Flies.
    * The bestiary log was fixed in the 1.1 version, as it correctly refers to him as Damselfly.
* One of the Dive Bombs Riz can use is the "Ink Bomb", which cannot be used by Team Snakemouth. Its sprite is a dark purple version of the [Clear Bomb](/Clear_Bomb).
