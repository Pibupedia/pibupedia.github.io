**Burglars** are ladybugs found in the [Lost Sands](/Lost_Sands). They can steal items from the player and must be defeated or hit by an attack that flips to retake it. They will attempt to flee after successfully taking an item.

After Chapter 3, a Burglar will appear as an NPC resting next to the [Stream Mountain](/Stream_Mountain) oasis. This is the same burglar that attempted to ambush the [Traveling Caravan](/Traveling_Caravan).

During the quest [Theater Help Wanted!](/Theater_Help_Wanted!), a special Burglar is fought. This Burglar has more HP, drops twice as much EXP and can summon [thieves](/thief) or [bandits](/Bandit).

{% include spies.md Bestiary="These Ladybugs turned to crime after their exile, doing little to improve their already poor reputation. They still dream of returning to the Ant Kingdom, despite their crimes. It's undeniable, however, that their actions only make that dream stray further away." Kabbu="This burglar... Must he be like this? Have Ladybugs not been tarnished enough? We can't afford to feel sorry for him, though, for he is fast and strong... We must stay firm and fight back!" Leif="Burglars... It's a shame how Bugaria seems so unsafe these days... We won't show mercy. We'll teach them a lesson they won't forget." Vi="Ugh... This is bad. Burglars are the worst! I can't believe how fast they can tackle, being so big...They're tough and good at stealing too... I hate them! Let's finish this quick!" %}
