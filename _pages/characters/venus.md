Statues of Venus can also be seen at Golden Hills and [Golden Settlement](/Golden_Settlement). [Acolyte Aria](/Acolyte_Aria) is one of her worshippers.

## Appearance
Venus is a tall pink flower with three petals, pink eyes and light green leaf 'furs' attached to a green body that consists of vines.

## Personality
When [Team Snakemouth](/Team_Snakemouth) first encounters her face-by-face, she is annoyed by the appearance of the team's greed (presumably [Vi](/Vi)'s caring more about the Ancient Artifacts than her allies). But, after the team explains about their trip, combining with her own experience on them, she decides to give the team a chance by testing their power with[ her guardian](/Venus'_Guardian). In this battle she does not attack directly, but instead orders the guardian to perform a set of attacks and powers it up with her magic (as seen in the background). After her guardian's defeat, impressed by the team's power and companionship (though still dissatisfied with Vi's greed), she answers the team's questions, and entrusts them with the Ancient Tablet. Later in the team's adventures, Venus continues supporting the team via [Venus' Buds](/Venus'_Bud), which fully heals the team for 8 berries which can be discounted to 5 berries by completing the [Team Snakemouth...](/Team_Snakemouth...) quest, as well as offering potentially helpful hints through chatting. 

Venus initially put up an unapproachable and somewhat hostile facade, but later, after [the team](/Team_Snakemouth) passes her trial, reveal her friendlier, somewhat mischievous side, commonly showing concern for the party if talked to through [her buds](/Venus'_Bud).
