COME GET SOME!" speaker="Seedling Slayer" %}The **Seedling Slayer** is an [ant](/ant) and adventurer that aims to defeat all [seedlings](/Seedling). She can be found in the Ant Kingdom Commercial Area, proudly boasting of having bought armor, equipped medals, and ranked up thrice. Commentary from [Vi](/Vi) and [Leif](/Leif) tease her on her choice of target and the cheap quality of her armor, despite [Kabbu's](/Kabbu) chiding for being judgmental.

After the [Chapter 5](/Chapter_5:_The_Far_Wildlands) invasion of the [Ant Kingdom](/Ant_Kingdom), she can be seen lamenting her inability to stop the Wasps despite her preparations. Vi and Leif choose not to take this opportunity to rub salt on the Slayer's wounds since she at least tried to help, to Kabbu's pride.

She regains her spirit in the postgame, declaring that the newly-gained peace has marked the renewal of her quest to become the Seedling Slayer.
