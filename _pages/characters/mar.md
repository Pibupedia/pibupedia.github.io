**Mar** is a mantis found in [Defiant Root](/Defiant_Root)'s bar during [Chapter 4: Mysterious Lost Sands](/Chapter_4:_Mysterious_Lost_Sands). He is the persona of one of Bug Fables' developers, Marcio Cleiton. After Chapter 4, Mar leaves Defiant Root and is not encountered again until the ending ceremony in [Ant City](/Ant_Kingdom_City), where he can be talked to on top of the Ant City's Inn with the rest of the developers, after which he will not appear again.
