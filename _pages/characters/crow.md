**Crow** is a [Bee](/Bee) who works as an assistant to [Doctor H.B.](/Doctor_H.B.) in the [Bee Kingdom Hive](/Bee_Kingdom_Hive).

She is one of the four [Spy Cards](/Spy_Cards) masters who must be faced before entering the spy cards tournament on [Metal Island](/Metal_Island). When Crow is defeated, she will upgrade the party's card to the next level.

## Appearance & Personality
Crow is a light-colored, medium-sized bee with folded back antennae, fluffy neck fur, and a rounded grey lab coat. She is almost always seen with a worried expression carrying a stack of papers.

Although she is very timid when first encountered, she will toss all of her papers into the air and take a confident stance when she reveals herself as a Card Master. Doctor H.B. shows obvious displeasure whenever she does this, and Crow returns to her normal, timid expression after the battle concludes.
