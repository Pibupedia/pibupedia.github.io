*Elom** is a hidden character located in a cave across a river west of the entrance to the Golden Hills tunnel. [Leif's](/Leif) [icicle skill](/Field_Skills) is required to reach him. He gives you the quest [In Search of Something](/In_Search_of_Something) where he asks you to go find a "Golden Paradise."

This "Golden Paradise" is, in part, hinting at the [Golden Hills](/Golden_Hills), where Goddess [Venus](/Venus) resides. There, a pink mole cricket named [Tekci](/Tekci) offers to help fulfill his request.

The two bugs decide to, for now, stay in the cave together and Elom gives you a [Lore Book](/Lore_Books) to express his thanks.
