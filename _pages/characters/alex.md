**Alex** is a citizen of the Ant Kingdom who lives in the [Residential District](/Ant_Kingdom_City), in a house that appears to be made from a discarded container of sardines. He gives the quest [It's Time...!](/It's_Time...!)

## Appearance
Alex seems to be some sort of moth. He stands at around [Leif](/Leif)'s height. His torso, head, and most of his legs are covered in ash-grey fur, with a prominent tuft of the fur on his chest. His arms and legs are a darker grey, while his antennae and wings are a pale yellow color. He is missing an eye, which causes it to appear permanently shut. His remaining eye is a matching color to that of his wings and antennae. He's almost always frowning.

## Trivia
* He claims to have lost his eye to a [Water Strider](/Water_Strider).
* The fact that he lives in an old sardine packaging is a reference to the fact he used to be a sailor until he lost his eye.
