**Futes** is a mantis obsessed with the Wasps. She is the persona of one of Bug Fables' developers, Futes. She can be found outside the Wasp Kingdom border wall at the edge of the Lost Sands, waiting patiently to gain access to the Wasp territory. Once the gate at the border wall is brought down, Futes makes her way into the Wasp Kingdom where she is later found imprisoned along with several other travelers, including [Bub](/Bub), [Rob](/Rob), an Ant, a Wasp, and [Amber](/Amber).
