## Appearance
The standard Ant Guard wears armor emblazoned with the Ant Kingdom Crest and wields a tall wooden stick, with a leaf attached on its end.

The Ant Guard's alternate appearance has no helmet, but does have protective shoulder plates, and wields a spear.

## Personality
Ant Guards are known for their unbridled loyalty to their Queen, and have a tendency not to talk very much.

Demonstrating their incredible loyalty, Ant Guards will give their all when fighting forces hostile to the citizens of the Ant Kingdom. During invasions, they fight so hard that many of them collapse of exhaustion. They have a duty to the citizens of the Ant Kingdom as well, and make sure to evacuate them safely.[Category:Characters](/Category:Characters)
