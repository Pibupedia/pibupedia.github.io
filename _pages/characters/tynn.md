**Tynn**[<sup>[1]</sup>](#references) is a [Termite](/Termite) who can be encountered in the Dome Hotel of [Termite Capitol](/Termite_Capitol) after beating the [Colosseum](/Colosseum). She used to run T & W Inn in [Defiant Root](/Defiant_Root) together with [Wayde](/Wayde), forming the T of the inn's name, until she returned into the [Termite Kingdom](/Termite_Kingdom) once termites started isolating themselves.

After asking Wayde is he okay prior to arriving to Dome Hotel, [Team Snakemouth](/Team_Snakemouth) can talk to her and convince her to return to Defiant Root's inn and reunite with Wayde. Doing so lowers the price of Defiant Root's inn to 7 berries and unlocks a room on the second floor, where a [Lore Book](/Lore_Books) can be found.

## Personality
Tynn and Wayde used to work together in the Defiant Root, but she left, since she wanted to return into the Termite Kingdom to try to give a warm inn experience to its visitors. However, she is left disappoined since many tourists had a preference to apartments, so she chose to let her friend [Tommy](/Tommy) run the inn for her, and ended up feeling herself unneeded. Once Team Snakemouth advices her to return into Defiant Root, pointing out that she feels unhappy in the Termite Kingdom and is missed by Wayde in "T & W" inn, she realizes her mistake and heads back into Defiant Root, where she is reunited with her old partner.

After reuniting with Wayde, Tynn becomes noticably happier to work together with her old partner and is grateful for Team Snakemouth helping them reunite. She lowers the inn stay price for the team and leaves them a Lore Book as a gift in her old room.
