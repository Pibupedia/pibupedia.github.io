She also stars in the quest [Theater Help Wanted!](/Theater_Help_Wanted!) in which [Team Snakemouth](/Team_Snakemouth) help her in an upcoming play. In this repeatable quest, Chubee plays the lead role of a princess who gets kidnapped by the [Evil Prince](/Burglar).

## Appearance

## Personality
She's a good sport, and an actor, she's also happy most of the time. When Chubee first meets the [Team](/Team_Snakemouth), she says she's [Vi](/Vi)'s biggest fan, and that she's inspired by a Bee who's trying something new. She congratulates [Leif](/Leif) for his victory during the eating contest. She's also a good actor who pleases the crowd and she plays the role of the Princess. She becomes extremely upset if the play goes wrong (the team is defeated).[Category:Characters](/Category:Characters)
