## Appearance
He is a rather hefty Moth, with pale skin and orange fur. He rests on top of a pillow made with the characteristic textiles of [Defiant Root](/Defiant_Root).

## Personality
He is very trusting of Team Snakemouth, despite having just met the exploration team for the first time, he lends them his pet Bed Bug. He seems to give his customers reasonable prices, charging just 30 berries per use, when [Vi](/Vi) says she would charge way more, although this could just be in reference to Vi's greedy business tactics.[Category:Characters](/Category:Characters)
