## Overworld Spy
**Vi:** "Merab's the owner of the Medal shop! He traveled everywhere for his collection!"

**Leif:** "Which he is now selling at high prices."

**Kabbu:** "Indeed. It's surprising that he would part with his possessions, but I won't judge. After all, these will be quite useful on our journey."

**Vi:** "Travel, treasure, and power! Now that's the life!"<br />
