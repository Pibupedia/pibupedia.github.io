**M.M.** (short for **Masked Moth**) is an actor in the [Ant Kingdom](/Ant_Kingdom)'s [theater](/Bugaria_Theater). As his name implies, he wears a mask which, while it might seem like it is only half of one, covers his entire face as revealed by [Vi](/Vi) when the "Help" button is pressed near him.

After completing the main storyline, Team Snakemouth can speak with M.M. to rewatch the game's credits.

## Trivia

* M.M. references Shakespeare's *Romeo and Juliet* as he acts parodied lines from the play, if Team Snakemouth tries to talk with him too early in the game.
* When spoken to post-game, M.M. suggests that the *[Bug Fables: The Everlasting Sapling](/Bug_Fables:_The_Everlasting_Sapling)* ending credits was a play he directed.
