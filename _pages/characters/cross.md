{% include spies.md Bestiary="Cross is a skilled but naive border guard, who always checks with his partner Poi for a second opinion. He uses a crossbow to complement his naturally close-range attacks." Kabbu="I'm sorry, Cross. We never meant to drag you into this...Everyone, watch out for his crossbow. We must give them a worthy battle!" Vi="Whoa, that's a nice crossbow! Maybe I should try new weapons sometime...Tough bite, too. We can't give him a chance to use all his attacks!" Leif="This one's got buff arms and fancy weapons. Deadly combo. Termites handle the cold well. Guess it's up to us if we want to gamble on it." %}

## Battle Information
TBD

## Trivia
* Succulent Platters used by Cross and Poi are weaker than the normal ones, as they can only target a single character.
