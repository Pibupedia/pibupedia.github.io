**Bomby** is a hat-wearing Beefly found in [Ant Kingdom City's](/Ant_Kingdom_City) residential area. 

He loses his hat during the [Golden Festival](/Golden_Festival), so [the team](/Team_Snakemouth) must find and return it to him in order to complete the [Dropped my Hat!](/Dropped_my_Hat!) quest.

## Appearance
Bomby has tawny skin and brown fur. His stripes alternate between a sandy color and a tawny color. He has a beak and large, shiny, black eyes.

He is quite short, not much taller than [Ann](/Ann) or [Tod](/Tod), only passing their heights when he wears his distinctive top hat.

## Personality
Bomby's childish personality is highly dependent on whether or not he is wearing his top hat, a prized gift from his mother. With his top hat, he is unusually confident, and tries to charm bugs like [Vi](/Vi) by calling her a "cutie bee," which never fails to bother her. However, without it, he loses all his pride, and becomes miserable. When his hat is returned to him, he then immediately regains all of his confidence.[Category:Characters](/Category:Characters)
