**Team Slacker** is an [Exploration Team](/Exploration_Team) formed by [Stratos](/Stratos) and [Delilah](/Delilah)**. **Following [Chapter 3: Factory Inspection](/Chapter_3:_Factory_Inspection), they offer information about the locations of [bounties](/bounties).

## Trivia
* Team Slacker are based on the protagonists of the earlier role-playing game concept that was scrapped by Moonsprout Games. Because the developers were fond of the characters, they decided to reuse them for *Bug Fables*, but the characters were significantly altered to fit the game's aesthetic; namely, Stratos went from a lizard to a Hercules beetle, while Delilah went from jellyfish to mosquito.[<sup>[1]</sup>](#references)
* The name "Team Slacker" may come from the team of the same name featured in Pokemon: Mystery Dungeons.
* Team Slacker, [Team Ant](/Gen_and_Eri), and [Team Snakemouth](/Team_Snakemouth) are the only known teams in Bug Fables whose names are not based on the leader.
