**Crisbee** is a chef who works in a bakery in [Defiant Root](/Defiant_Root). His exclusive dish is the [Crisbee Donut](/Crisbee_Donut), which recovers 12 TP with no downsides, and can be made from a [Glazed Honey](/Glazed_Honey) and a [Bag of Flour](/Bag_of_Flour). He also sells various foodstuffs in his bakery.

## Appearance
Crisbee is a chubby male bee who wears a blue hat and a blue apron, with sky blue eyes. He wears a red flower on the left side of his cream-colored fur.

## Personality
Crisbee is a very diligent and friendly chef and enjoys practicing cooking with others. He is also very modest, and when he doesn't cook well, instead of blaming the quality or combination of the ingredients, he simply apologizes for his mistake. He is a bit of a coward and is afraid of monstrous beings, as seen when he hides away from the [Abomihoneys](/Abomihoney_(enemy)) when he tries to cook an [Abombination](/Abombination).

## Trivia
* When the outcome is a [Mistake](/Mistake) or any other recipe that is considered as a 'failure', his oven will slightly inflate before the 'fail' sound effect plays.
* Funnily enough, his bakery with Bag of Flour on sale is just next to a market where a Dry Bread, also crafted from a singular Bag of Flour, is sold with 3 berries more expensive than Bag of Flour.
* Crisbee is not a Bugarian bee, having arrived from another land. Due to this fact, he was not aware that mixing honey too thick or heating it up too much caused it to become an Abomihoney.[<sup>[3]</sup>](#references)
* In the early 0.5 build version of Bug Fables, Crisbee used to use Fry's theme. [<sup>[4]</sup>](#references)
* Crisbee's species has discrepancies. Crisbee's original creator, Sirfy, states that Crisbee is a Solitary Bee. However, the art book states Crisbee is a Carpenter Bee.
