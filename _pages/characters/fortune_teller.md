The **fortune teller**<ref name=":0">*Bug Fables: The Everlasting Sapling* artbook</ref> is a beetle that claims to be able to see the future. He will tell [Team Snakemouth](/Team_Snakemouth) the locations of [Crystal Berries](/Crystal_Berries), [Lore Books](/Lore_Books), and [Medals](/Medals) in exchange for berries. 

He is [Charmy](/Charmy)'s brother<ref name=":0" />.

If the team has collected every instance of a collectable, he will refund them their berries if they used a fortune on it. Medals bought from shops or received as rewards do not have fortunes.
