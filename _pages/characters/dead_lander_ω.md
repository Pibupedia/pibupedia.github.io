**Dead Lander Ω**[<sup>[1]</sup>](#references) is a mysterious creature that keeps watch over [Giant's Lair](/Giant's_Lair). When it spots [Team Snakemouth](/Team_Snakemouth), it'll attempt to deploy a [Dead Lander γ](/Dead_Lander_Gamma) on their location.

There is only one Dead Lander Ω. It has more than two eyes and two arms. Its fairly obscured silhouette can be seen passing by while using the [Elias](/Elias)cope to the right of the house containing Giant's Lair.

## Trivia
* Genow, one of the developers of Bug Fables, has stated that the other Dead Landers fear Dead Lander Ω, and are not allied with it. [<sup>[2]</sup>](#references)
* Mar, one of the developers of Bug Fables, has stated the sprite used for its silhouette while viewing the Eliascope is actually just [Spider's](/Spider) head tinted black. [<sup>[3]</sup>](#references)
