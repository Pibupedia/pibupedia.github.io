## Mechanics
There are five different charms that all have a 5.5% chance of activating under certain conditions. After a charm is activated, there is a random 3 to 8 turn cooldown before another can activate. The end of a turn is counted after every enemy has acted. Once a battle is finished, the cooldown is removed.
