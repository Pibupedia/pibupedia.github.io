**Madame Jaune**<ref name=":0">*Bug Fables: The Art of Bugaria*, page 57</ref> is [Vi](/Vi)'s close sister. She is an artist who paints art for the [Bee Queen](/Queen_Bianca) in the [Bee Kingdom](/Bee_Kingdom).

## <span class
Jaune is a tall light-orange bee with a blue artist hat, brown eyes and a paintbrush that replaces the stinger. Her antennae are also curled in a spiral-like shape.

## Personality
As one of the painters who makes art for the queen, Jaune is very hardworking and ambitious. She does not like to be disturbed by others when creating art.

Comparing to her sister, Jaune is more mature and rational. Upon her first meeting with [Team Snakemouth](/Team_Snakemouth), she is angry towards Vi (who insulted her art skills, telling her that she drew like a [Weevil](/Weevil), in response to Jaune's constant belittlement of Vi's ambitions to become an explorer) and does not want to forgive her entire history of insults just because she and her teammates saved the [Honey Factory](/Honey_Factory). However, when Vi gets the [Red Paint](/Red_Paint) and actually apologizes for her rudeness in the past, Jaune begins to understand Vi, her own inconsiderateness and eventuallyÂ makes up with her, and also paints a picture (titled A Bond Thicker than Honey) despite being busy with the [Queen](/Queen_Bianca)'s. After that, she allows the team to rest at her art room for free.

## Trivia

* Jaune appeared in the v1.0 demo. Her relationship with [Vi](/Vi) was unknown, and she was the only painter of [Bee Kingdom](/Bee_Kingdom) at that time. She teaches the team the secondary field abilities in that demo, although only Bee Fly is used.
* "Jaune" is French for "yellow". Similarly, her sister Vi's full name is "Violet," a shade of purple. Additionally, yellow and purple are complementary colors in the color wheel.
    * According to Genow in the manual of the limited run physical edition of Bug Fables, Jaune pronounces "Vi" like "Vye" instead of "Vee."
* [Artia](/Artia) sees her as a rival and tries to outdo her artwork with her own pieces.
* Originally, Jaune would accept rare art pieces [Team Snakemouth](/Team_Snakemouth) offered her, but this was cut very early on.<ref name=":0" />
    * The original concept for Jaune was that Vi had two sisters who fought with her, but the developers decided to focus on only one.<ref name=":0" />
