**Pinky**[<sup>[1]</sup>](#references) is a friendly spider found in the [Forsaken Lands](/Forsaken_Lands). She lives in a small crevice found after completing the quest [Best Friend In The Fog!](/Best_Friend_In_The_Fog!).

After completing the quest, [Rose](/Rose) will offer to transport [Team Snakemouth](/Team_Snakemouth) between the [Termite Capitol](/Termite_Capitol) and Pinky's home for free.

Pinky will buy items for twice their retail selling price, dropping the payment as berries on the ground. On the first item sold, she will drop a [Crystal Berry](/Crystal_Berry) as well.

An efficient way to farm berries is to buy [Longleg Summoners](/Longleg_Summoner) from the [Wizard's Tower](/Wizard's_Tower) and sell them to Pinky. Their sale price is much higher than their buy price, generating a lot of profit.

## Trivia
* The [Jumping Spider](/Jumping_Spider) and Pinky share the same model.
* [Dark Cherries](/Dark_Cherries) do not benefit from being sold to Pinky and sell for 50 berries as they do at regular shops.
