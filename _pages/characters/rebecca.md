She wears a two-sectioned dress, with the bottom part being purple and the top and largest part being a shade of crimson. At the top base of her neck is a white crystal. She slouches as she stand and her abdomen has two rings around it, each with a white crystal. [thumb](/File:Rebeccaandleif.PNG)

## Trivia

    * Other amputees in the game include [Anna](/Anna) and [Astotheles](/Astotheles).
* Rebecca was originally going to her own quest in the original version of the game, but it was forgotten about.[<sup>[1]</sup>](#references)
