**Muse** was [Leif](/Leif)'s wife. She is noted to have looked remarkably similar to [Muze](/Muze), but with a completely different personality.

## Appearance
Muze's skin, wings, and abdomen are all pink, so it is likely safe to assume that Muse also had a very pink appearance. Although, as can be seen with [Muze's father](/Muze's_father) and [Tod](/Tod), color may not always be passed down through the generations, so it is possible that Muze and Muse share other visual attributes.

## Personality
Leif describes Muse as "loud, confident, and outgoing." Not much is known about about Muse's personality, but Leif remembers her as doing most of the work in their relationship. Compared to Leif back then, when he had no ice magic, she had greater combat ability, as she had "pretty strong kicks."[Category:Characters](/Category:Characters)
